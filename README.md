# MEANTodos
A simple MEAN app using Angular4 , Node.js , MongoDB and Express

In the client/dist folder i've put the Compiled source code from the Source code folder ,
so that u dont have to compile it again ,
However if u want to compile by yourself,
then change the client folder name to something else eg."Client1" and 
then change the source code folder name to client .

# Angular CLI

Rename the Source code folder to client and then run

npm install 

after changing directory to client in ur terminal.
This command will install all of the dependencies required for source code to run.

Source code folder is created with angular cli so if u want to compile it run command

ng build

It will compie ur source code and put it in dist folder inside client.
